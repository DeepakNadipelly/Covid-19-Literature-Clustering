# Covid-19-Literature-Clustering

Given the large number of documents and the rapid spread of the CoronaVirus, it has been challenging for healthcare professionals to stay updated with the new information re- garding the virus. This is where we thought clustering similar documents could be helpful. Since the problem is unsupervised as we do not have any labels for the clusters, we plan to use topic modeling and extract keywords to associate these clusters to relevant topics. Highly similar Publications will have the same label and will be plotted in the form of a cluster. Topic modeling will be used to find the keywords in the clusters. There is a need for these approaches to be applied and derive meaningful insights as the information about these topics is increasing rapidly, with many articles being written and published every day.
